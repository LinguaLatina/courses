## Summary

| Aeacus was the son of Jupiter and Aegina and the grandfather of Achilles. After his death, he became one of the three judges in the Underworld as a result of his decisiveness and good judgement on Earth. Further, the citizens of Aegina (the Island named after his mother) named him their exclusive deity after his passing. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeacus>
