# Aeolus


Contribution by *Allison Attea*


## Summary

| Aeolus was the god of the winds and ruler of the islands between Italy and Sicily. He was the son of Jupiter and Menalippa. Aeolus kept the winds shut away in caverns and would only let them loose when Jupiter told him to. He was the father of six sons and six daughters who all ended up marrying each other. Furthermore, he aided Odysseus on his journey home from Troy by giving him a bag of wind. After this gift, Aeolus never helped out the Greeks again.
