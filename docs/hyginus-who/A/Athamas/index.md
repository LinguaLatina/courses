# Athamas


Contribution by *Anna Conlon*


## Summary

| Athamas was a mythologized king of central Greece, in the area of Boeotia. He had children by Nephele (a goddess), Ino, and Themisto. Due his conniving wives and their conflicts between themselves and others, he was plagued with madness and the deaths of various children. He has various places in Greece named after himself or his children, including the Athamanian plain, the Athamanean mountains, and Hellespont. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athamas>
