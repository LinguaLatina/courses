# Aurora


Contribution by *Lyra Chen *


## Summary

| Aurora was the rosy-fingered goddess of the dawn. Her Greek name was Eos. Eos had an unquenchable desire for handsome young men, and often appeared in sexual poetry. One of her loves was the Trojan prince Tithonos. She petitioned Jupiter for Tithonos's immortality, but she neglected to request eternal youth. In time he shrivelled up by old age, and Aurora turned him into a cicada. ref: <https://www.theoi.com/Titan/Eos.html> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(mythology)>
