# Cassandra


Contribution by *Lyra Chen*


## Summary

| Cassandra was a princess of Troy, the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba and the fraternal twin sister of Helenus. She was a priestess of Apollo. She was cursed to utter true prophecies, but never to be believed. She foretold that Paris, her brother, would bring about a war that would destroy their city, if he went to Sparta. She also foretold that Troy would fall by a clever machination of the Greeks, the Trojan Horse, in which they would hide. After the fall of Troy, she was taken by Agamemnon back to his home. She foretold the plots of Clytemnestra, Agamemnon's wife, and Clytemnestra's lover, Aegisthus to kill Agamemnon and her.  <https://pantheon.org/articles/c/cassandra.html> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra>
