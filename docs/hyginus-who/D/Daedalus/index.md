# Daedalus


Contribution by *Erin Eason*


## Summary

| Daedalus is an architect, craftsman, and artist. In classic mythology, he was seen as a symbol for wisdom, knowledge and power. Originally he was from Athens, but was exiled to Crete because he killed his apprentice, Perdix, whom he was jealous of. He is the father of Icarus. A famous story he is known for is being imprisoned in a labyrinth by King Minos of Crete and escaping with his son by using wings made of wax. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalus>
