## Summary

| Diana is considered the patroness of hunters, crossroads, the countryside, and the moon. She is equated to the greek goddess Artemis. She is a virgin goddess and known as the protector of childbirth. Traditionally she made up a triad with Egeria, the water nymph, and Virbius, the woodland god. Her symbols are the bow and quiver, hunting dogs, and a crescent moon. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)>
