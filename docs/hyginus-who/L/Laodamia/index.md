# Laodamia


Contribution by *Cole Jarchow*


## Summary

| The daughter of Acastus, she was married to Protesilaus who went to fight in the Trojan War. When Protesilaus was killed during the war, the gods allowed him to see Laodamia for only three hours before he had to go to the underworld because they were only recently married. After the Protesilaus went to the underworld, Laodamia made a bronze figure of her dead husband and she dedicated herself to it. To end her suffering, Acastus burned the figure of Protesilaus and the offerings with it. However, Laodamia could not endure this and she threw herself into the fire and died. <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Laodamia_of_Phylace>
