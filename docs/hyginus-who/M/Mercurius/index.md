Contribution by *Ronan Marrinan*


## Summary

| The Roman god Mercury was the son of Jupiter and Maia. Mercury is the god of the merchants, shopkeepers, thieves, and tricksters. (Augustyn, paragraph 1) He was often viewed as mischievous, tricky, clever, and swift.  Mercury is often depicted in the nude, although he sometimes wore a short tunic, winged shoes, and a cloak fastened around his neck. (Apel, paragraph 5)Mercury was also the only Roman god who could freely cross into the underworld.  He was in fact responsible for crossing souls into the underworld. <https://mythopedia.com/roman-mythology/gods/mercury/> <https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mercury-Roman-god>
