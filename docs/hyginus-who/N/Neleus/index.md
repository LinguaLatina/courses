# Neleus


Contribution by *Ronan Marrinan*


## Summary

| Neleus is the son of Poseidon and Tyro and a twin brother of Pelius. As babies, Tyro left Neleus and Pelius to die on a mountain, but a maid found them and raised them. When the twins became adults they wanted to find their mother, who was being mistreated by their stepmother Siderio. Despite Siderio's attempts to evade the twins, Pelius found her and killed her. Following this the twins had a disagreement and Pelius went on to become king of locus, whereas Neleus went to Messenia and created a new city called Pylos.  <https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/neleus.html> <https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Neleus/neleus.html>
