# Scylla


Contribution by *Nick Tormey*


## Summary

| In Hyginus, Scylla is a sea monster with four eyes, six heads with razor-sharp teeth, twelve tentacles, and six dog's heads around her waist. She attained this form after the goddess Circe was jealous of her relationship with Glaucus. Circe then poisoned the water in which Scylla bathed, transforming her into a monster. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scylla>
